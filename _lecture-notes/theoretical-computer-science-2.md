# Theoretical Computer Science

## Overview
This lecture explores the foundations of computation, diving into abstract models and their implications for modern systems. We examine core concepts that shape how computers process information.

## Key Topics
- **Automata Theory**: Understanding finite state machines and their role in modeling computation.
- **Complexity Classes**: Exploring P, NP, and the boundaries of solvable problems.
- **Turing Machines**: A look at universal computation and its theoretical limits.

## Discussion Points
- How do theoretical models influence practical algorithm design?
- What are the limits of computation in solving real-world problems?

*Next lecture: Advanced topics in computability.*
