# Birthday Bash Planning

Planning a birthday party can be a blast! Here’s a quick guide to make it unforgettable.

## Pick a Theme
Choose something fun—superheroes, tropical vibes, or a classic retro party. Themes set the mood!

## Guest List & Invites
Keep it intimate or go big. Digital invites are easy, but a handwritten note adds a personal touch.

## Food & Drinks
- Cupcakes or a custom cake (chocolate is always a win).
- Simple snacks: chips, dips, or a DIY taco bar.
- Mocktails or a signature drink for flair.

## Activities
Plan a mix of chill and lively:
- Playlist with crowd-pleasers.
- Games like charades or a photo booth with props.

Pro tip: Keep the schedule loose—let the day flow naturally. Happy birthday vibes!
