# Post-Test Reflections

Just finished a test? Here’s a quick way to debrief and move forward.

## What Went Well
- Nailed that tricky section? Celebrate the wins, big or small.
- Felt prepared? Pat yourself on the back for studying smart.

## What to Improve
- Time management off? Practice pacing next time.
- Missed key concepts? Jot them down for review.

## Next Steps
- Take a break—you earned it.
- Review notes or ask for feedback.
- Set one goal for the next test (e.g., “Read questions twice”).

Tests are just checkpoints. Learn, grow, and keep going!
