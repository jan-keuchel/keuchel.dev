# Why I Love Mornings

Mornings set the tone for the day. Here’s why I’m all about that AM energy.

## The Quiet Start
- No notifications, just calm.
- Perfect time for coffee and a quick journal session.

## Productivity Boost
- Tackle one big task before noon—feels like a win.
- Morning walks or stretches clear the mind.

## Simple Routine
- Wake up at the same time daily.
- Quick breakfast: oatmeal or a smoothie.
- Plan the day with a short to-do list.

Mornings are a fresh slate. Make them yours!
